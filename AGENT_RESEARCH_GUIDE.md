# AI Agent Research Repository Guide

## Repository Purpose and Vision

This repository serves as a comprehensive research collection hub for **ChatGPT Agent** and **Codebase Generation Prompt Engineering** research. The primary goal is to aggregate multiple AI model perspectives and research approaches to create a diverse, valuable knowledge base that can be used for iterative research and development.

## Key Principles

### 1. Multi-Model Perspective Collection
- **Diversity is Strength**: Each AI model brings unique insights and approaches
- **No Single Truth**: Multiple valid perspectives are more valuable than one "correct" analysis
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Different models complement each other's strengths

### 2. Structured Organization
- **Strict Directory Schema**: Must be followed exactly for consistency
- **Naming Conventions**: Two-digit prefixes + kebab-case descriptors
- **Model-Specific Folders**: Each model contributes to its own designated folder

### 3. Quality Over Uniformity
- **Depth Over Breadth**: Comprehensive analysis preferred over surface-level coverage
- **Technical Rigor**: Include code examples, architectural diagrams, and detailed implementations
- **Practical Applicability**: Focus on actionable insights and real-world implementations

## Directory Structure and Naming Schema

### Required Folder Structure
```
repository-root/
├── chatgpt-agent-research/
│   ├── o3/
│   ├── claude-4-sonnet/
│   ├── claude-4-opus/
│   └── [other-models]/
└── codebase-generation-prompt-research/
    ├── o3/
    ├── claude-4-sonnet/
    ├── claude-4-opus/
    └── [other-models]/
```

### Required File Naming Schema
Each model folder must contain exactly these files:
- `01_overview.md`
- `02_architecture-deep-dive.md`
- `03_codebase-setup.md`
- `04_prompt-structure.md`
- `05_enhancements.md`

### Critical Rules for Naming
- **Two-digit numeric prefix**: Always use 01, 02, 03, etc. (not 1, 2, 3)
- **Kebab-case**: Use hyphens to separate words (not underscores or camelCase)
- **Exact filenames**: Do not deviate from the specified filenames
- **Model folder names**: Use exact model names (claude-4-sonnet, not claude-sonnet)

## Working with Existing Content

### When Content Already Exists
1. **Never Overwrite**: Existing content from other models is valuable
2. **Add Perspective**: Append your analysis clearly marked with your model identity
3. **Complement, Don't Duplicate**: Focus on unique insights your model can provide
4. **Preserve All Research**: Multiple perspectives are the goal, not consensus

### Handling Conflicts
1. **Identify Model Source**: Clearly mark which model contributed which content
2. **Preserve All Viewpoints**: Don't merge or "reconcile" different approaches
3. **Add Separators**: Use clear markdown separators (---) between different model contributions
4. **Timestamp Contributions**: Include when content was added if multiple updates occur

### Content Integration Strategy
```markdown
# Existing Model Content
[Original content here]

---

# Additional Research Perspective: [Your Model Name]
[Your unique analysis and insights here]
```

## Model Identity and Attribution

### Clear Model Identification
- **File Headers**: Include your model name in file headers
- **Content Sections**: Mark your contributions clearly
- **Unique Perspectives**: Emphasize what makes your analysis different

### Example Model Attribution
```markdown
# ChatGPT Agent Overview - Claude 4 Sonnet Analysis

[Content specific to Claude 4 Sonnet's perspective]
```

## Technical Implementation Standards

### Code Examples
- **Production Quality**: Write code as if it will be used in production
- **Comprehensive**: Include error handling, logging, monitoring
- **Well-Documented**: Add docstrings, comments, and explanations
