# ðŸš€ MCP Quick Start Guide

Welcome to MCP! This guide will help you get started in just a few minutes.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- **Python 3.8+** installed ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **Node.js 18+** installed ([Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/))

## ðŸŽ¯ One-Click Start

### Windows Users:
1. **Double-click** `run_mcp.bat`
2. The application will automatically:
   - Create a virtual environment (first time only)
   - Install all dependencies in the virtual environment
   - Start the backend server
   - Start the frontend server
   - Open your browser to the MCP Control Center

### Mac/Linux Users:
1. **Double-click** `run_mcp.sh` or run `./run_mcp.sh` in terminal
2. The application will automatically:
   - Create a virtual environment (first time only)
   - Install all dependencies in the virtual environment
   - Start the backend server
   - Start the frontend server
   - Open your browser to the MCP Control Center

### Alternative Method:
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
python launcher.py
```

## ðŸŽ® Using MCP Control Center

Once MCP is running, you'll see the Control Center in your browser at http://localhost:3000

### Main Features:

#### 1. **Dashboard (Overview Tab)**
- See all your research topics
- Monitor active agents
- Check pipeline status
- Quick action buttons for common tasks

#### 2. **Research Tab**
- **View existing research topics**: See all your research organized by topic
- **Create new topics**: 
  1. Click "Create New Research Topic"
  2. Enter a name (e.g., "AI Safety Research")
  3. Add a description
  4. Write your initial content in Markdown format
  5. Click "Create Research Topic"

#### 3. **Pipeline Tab**
- **Run the full pipeline**: Click "Start Pipeline" to process all research
- **Process specific topic**: Select a topic from the dropdown, then click "Start Pipeline"
- **Monitor progress**: Watch real-time progress through the 5 phases:
  - Research Collection
  - Synthesis
  - Experiment
  - Deploy
  - Optimize

#### 4. **Agents Tab**
- View all available AI agents
- See their capabilities and status

#### 5. **Settings Tab**
- System information
- Quick links to documentation
- API configuration info

## ðŸ”‘ API Keys (Optional)

To enable AI features, add your API keys to the `.env` file:
1. Open the `.env` file in a text editor
2. Replace the placeholder values:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-openai-key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-actual-anthropic-key
   ```
3. Save the file and restart MCP

## ðŸ›‘ Stopping MCP

To stop the application:
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal/command prompt
- Or close the terminal window

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Application won't start:
1. Make sure Python and Node.js are installed
2. Try running `python --version` and `node --version` to verify
3. If on Mac/Linux, make sure the script is executable: `chmod +x run_mcp.sh`

### "Backend API failed to start" error:
This is often due to Python environment or import issues. Try these solutions:

#### Solution 1: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'synthesized_agent'
This happens when Python can't find the modules. Fix:
```bash
# On Windows:
set PYTHONPATH=%CD%
python launcher.py

# On Mac/Linux:
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
python3 launcher.py
```

#### Solution 2: Manual Backend Start (Windows)
Use the simple backend starter:
```bash
start_backend.bat
```

#### Solution 3: Manual Dependency Installation
```bash
# Install Python packages manually
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Then run the launcher
python launcher.py
```

#### Solution 4: Use a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the launcher
python launcher.py
```

### Browser doesn't open automatically:
- Manually open http://localhost:3000

### Port already in use:
- Another application is using port 3000 or 8000
- Stop the other application or restart your computer

### Dependencies fail to install:
- Make sure you have an internet connection
- Try running as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Mac/Linux)
- On newer Linux systems, you may need to add `--break-system-packages` flag

## ðŸ“š Next Steps

1. **Create your first research topic** in the Research tab
2. **Run the pipeline** to see MCP in action
3. **Explore the API** at http://localhost:8000/docs
4. **Read the full documentation** in the repository

## ðŸŽ‰ That's it!

You're now ready to use MCP! The platform handles all the complex operations behind the scenes, so you can focus on your research and experiments.
