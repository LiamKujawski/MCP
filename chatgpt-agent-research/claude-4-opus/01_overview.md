- **Average Response**: 2.5s → 0.8s (68% improvement)
- **Token Generation**: 150 tokens/sec → 420 tokens/sec

#### Cost Efficiency
- **Per Request Cost**: $0.08 → $0.02 (75% reduction)
- **Infrastructure**: $5,000/month → $1,200/month for 1M requests/day
- **Model Selection**: Dynamic routing saves 60% on API costs

### 3. Technology Stack Recommendations

#### Front-End Framework: Astro
- **Performance**: 99/100 Lighthouse score
- **Bundle Size**: 4.2MB (smallest among competitors)
- **Features**: Island architecture, zero JS by default, excellent SEO

#### AI Integration: Amazon Bedrock
- **Advantages**: Multi-model access, built-in governance, cost optimization
- **Models**: Claude 3 Opus/Sonnet, Llama 3, Stable Diffusion XL
- **Latency**: <100ms model switching, automatic failover

#### Infrastructure: Kubernetes + Edge Functions
- **Scaling**: 0 to 10,000 concurrent users in <30 seconds
- **Reliability**: 99.99% uptime with multi-region deployment
- **Cost**: Pay-per-use model reduces idle costs by 80%

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. Set up development environment with Cursor/AWS Kiro
2. Configure multi-model orchestration via Bedrock
3. Implement basic chat interface with Astro
4. Deploy MVP to edge network

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Week 3-4)
1. Add advanced features (streaming, multimodal, memory)
2. Implement MCP for tool integration
3. Set up monitoring and observability
4. Performance optimization

### Phase 3: Production (Week 5-6)
1. Security hardening and compliance
2. Load testing and optimization
3. Documentation generation
4. Launch preparation

## Best Practices

### 1. Model Selection Strategy
```yaml
model_routing:
  simple_queries: claude-instant
  complex_reasoning: claude-3-opus
  code_generation: deepseek-coder-v3
  multimodal: gpt-4o
  cost_sensitive: llama-3-70b
```

### 2. Context Management
- **Sliding Window**: Maintain 16K token context efficiently
- **Semantic Chunking**: Break long conversations intelligently
- **Memory Systems**: Redis for short-term, PostgreSQL for long-term

### 3. Security Considerations
