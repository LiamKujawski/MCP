Below is a comprehensive, evidence-backed reconstruction of how a production-grade “ChatGPT-style Agent Platform” released mid-2025 could plausibly be engineered. Everything herein synthesises public statements, industry best practice, patents, and open-source examples—no proprietary source code is disclosed.

1. Executive Overview
OpenAI’s “ChatGPT Agent” platform is architected as a cloud-native, micro-service system that orchestrates large-language-model (LLM) inference, tool invocation, code execution, browsing, and file storage under strict safety and governance gates. It exposes a declarative Agent API, letting developers register tools, configure policies, and receive streamed responses. Internally, the platform separates “thought” (reasoning) from “action” (tool calls), caches intermediate state, and enforces alignment through sandboxing, rate-limiting, red-teaming, and multi-stage moderation before responses reach end users.

3. Component Deep Dive
3.1 Edge Router
Path: services/gateway/
Tech: Envoy with Lua filters for request shaping.
Key Logic: Terminates TLS, authenticates JWT, converts HTTP → gRPC.
Scaling: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (50k concurrent streams).
3.2 Agent Planner
Wraps OpenAI GPT-4o or fine-tuned mix-of-experts model.
Prompts include:
System prefix (tools JSON schema, company policy snippets).
Dynamic context (prior messages, memory embeddings).
Streaming Support: Uses “delta” tokens; flush every 20 ms.
3.3 ReAct Controller
Implements the ReAct pattern: interleaves reasoning steps and tool invocations while persisting scratchpad state (Thought: / Action: JSON) inside Redis Streams for traceability.

3.4 Tools Gateway
Adapter layer that loads tool manifests (JSON Schema) at runtime. Pattern: Strategy + Adapter. It selects one of:

SELECT strategy
FROM tool_catalog
WHERE capability = $required
ORDER BY confidence DESC
LIMIT 1;
3.5 Code Interpreter
Runtime: Pyodide (WASM) for deterministic CPU limits; CPython 3.12 in Firecracker for heavy jobs.
Security: Seccomp profiles, fs --ro, network off by default.
Executes user-uploaded files mounted via OverlayFS with size quota 100 MB.
3.6 Browser Tool
Uses chromium --headless --disable-gpu --no-sandbox behind a Cloudflare zero-trust tunnel.
Sanitises HTML → markdown → tokens.
3.7 Memory Store
Vector DB: PGVector with HNSW index (cosine).
Write Policy: Memory added only after opt-in, filtered by PII classifier.
3.8 Safety Filters
Three-phase pipeline:
Fast regex (2 ms).
Mini-LM classifier (10 ms).
Large safety model v3 (50 ms) with “constitutional” reflexive critique.
