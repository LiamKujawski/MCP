## 1. Front-end & Chat Interface

**Goal:** Select and implement the optimal front-end framework that balances performance, developer experience, multimodal capabilities, and AI readiness for content-heavy applications.

### Research-Driven Decision: Astro

After comprehensive analysis of performance metrics and real-world implementations, **Astro** emerges as the optimal choice for AI-powered applications requiring exceptional performance and content management capabilities.

**Rationale:**
- **Zero JavaScript by Default:** Achieves 99/100 Lighthouse performance scores with 0KB initial JavaScript payload
- **Largest Context Window Support:** 2M token context window when paired with Gemini, enabling sophisticated AI interactions
- **Superior Build Performance:** 4.2MB build output (vs Next.js 6.8MB, Nuxt 5.5MB)
- **Content-Focused Architecture:** Purpose-built for content-heavy sites with 10,000+ pages

**Supporting Evidence:**
- [Frontend Frameworks Comparison 2025](https://manojsatishkumar.com/blog/frontend-frameworks-comparison-2025.html)
- [DatoCMS Framework Analysis](https://www.datocms.com/blog/comparing-js-frameworks-for-content-heavy-sites)
- Benchmark: 10,001 blog posts test showed Astro delivering instant page loads with minimal resource usage

### Alternative Recommendations:

**For Rapid Prototyping: Qwik**
- **Resumability Architecture:** Near-zero JavaScript execution on initial load
- **Performance:** 54s build time for 1,250 posts (fastest among tested frameworks)
- **Use Case:** Applications requiring instant interactivity and minimal time-to-interactive

**For React Ecosystem: Next.js 15**
- **Mature Ecosystem:** 1000+ integrations available
- **Enterprise Support:** Proven at scale with Microsoft 365 integration
- **Trade-off:** Higher bundle size (120KB) and slower initial loads

### Implementation Blueprint:
```javascript
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import react from '@astrojs/react';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    react(), // For interactive components
    mdx(),   // For AI-generated content
  ],
  output: 'hybrid', // Static + SSR for AI endpoints
  adapter: cloudflare(), // Edge deployment
});
```

### Agent Instructions:
1. Initialize Astro project with TypeScript support
2. Configure hybrid rendering for optimal performance
3. Implement progressive enhancement for AI features
4. Set up component islands for interactive elements
5. Enable build-time optimization for static content
