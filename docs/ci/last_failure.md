# CI Pipeline Failures - Analysis

## Date: 2025-07-21

### Current Status

**Latest CI Pipeline Run**: 16408585377 - FAILED
**Latest Experiment Pipeline Run**: 16408585382 - FAILED

### Key Issues Identified:

1. **CI Pipeline**:
   - Integration tests may be skipped due to job dependencies
   - Deploy-staging job conditions need verification
   - Docker build issues with registry naming

2. **Experiment Pipeline**:
   - Not generating real implementations
   - Evaluation phase failing to find experiment directories
   - Missing dependencies in generated code

### Action Items:

1. Fix CI job dependencies to ensure integration tests run
2. Update deploy conditions to work with main branch
3. Fix experiment generation logic to create real implementations
4. Add proper error handling for missing directories

### Iteration 9 - Latest Run

**Run ID**: 16408663092 (CI Pipeline) - FAILED
**UI Tests Failure**:
- UI tests failed, causing all dependent jobs to be skipped
- Need to investigate specific UI test failure

**Run ID**: 16408663078 (Experiment Pipeline) - FAILED
**Issue**: Experiment pipeline also failed
- Need to check specific failure reason

## Next Steps

1. Check UI test logs for specific failure
2. Fix UI test issues (likely Lighthouse or Playwright)
3. Ensure experiment pipeline generates proper implementations
4. Re-run workflows after fixes
