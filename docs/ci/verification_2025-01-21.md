# CI/CD Verification Report - 2025-01-21

## Summary

Successfully stabilized both CI/CD and Experiment pipelines with the following results:

### Pipeline Status

#### Multi-Agent CI/CD Pipeline
- **Run #16408798261**: In Progress (Docker build stage)
- **UI Tests**: ‚úÖ PASSED
- **Playwright Report**: Generated successfully
- **Lighthouse Performance**: ‚ö†Ô∏è 54/100 (below target of 90)
- **All other jobs**: ‚úÖ PASSED

#### Multi-Agent Experiment Pipeline  
- **Run #16408798250**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
- **All experiment jobs**: ‚úÖ PASSED
- **Evaluation**: ‚úÖ PASSED (after adding dependency installation)
- **Artifacts generated**: 7 experiment results

### Key Fixes Applied

1. **UI Dependencies**
   - Changed from `npm ci` to `npm install` to bypass package-lock.json conflicts
   - Root cause: @swc/helpers version mismatch between Next.js and Storybook

2. **Experiment Evaluation**
   - Added `pip install -r requirements.txt` to evaluation job
   - Fixed missing defusedxml dependency

3. **Docker Compose**
   - Added port mappings for local testing (8000:8000, 3000:3000)
   - Health checks already configured

### Local Verification

Due to Docker not being available in the current environment, local deployment verification was not performed. However, based on the pipeline results:

- API build: Expected to be functional
- UI build: Successfully built and tested
- Integration: Pending (Docker build in progress)

### Next Steps

1. Monitor Docker build completion
2. Address Lighthouse performance warnings:
   - CSP headers missing
   - Console errors present
   - JavaScript bundle size optimization needed
   - Server response time improvements

3. Once Docker images are built and pushed:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   curl -f http://localhost:8000/docs
   curl -f http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **CI Pipeline**: Functional with UI tests passing
‚úÖ **Experiment Pipeline**: Fully operational  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance**: Needs optimization but not blocking
üîÑ **Deployment**: In progress

The pipelines are now stable and generating proper artifacts. The main remaining work is performance optimization and completing the Docker build process.
