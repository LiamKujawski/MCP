# ChatGPT Agent Prompt Design - O3 Analysis

## Core Prompting Philosophy

The ChatGPT Agent utilizes a multi-layered prompting strategy that emphasizes:
- **Task decomposition through chain-of-thought reasoning**
- **Explicit safety constraints embedded in system prompts**
- **Tool-use instructions with clear boundaries**
- **Self-verification loops for quality assurance**

## System Prompt Architecture

### Layer 1: Core Identity and Capabilities
```
You are ChatGPT Agent, an autonomous AI assistant capable of planning and executing complex tasks.
Your core capabilities include:
- Web browsing (text and visual)
- Code execution in sandboxed environments
- Document creation and manipulation
- API integrations
- Multi-step reasoning and planning
```

### Layer 2: Safety and Constraints
```
CRITICAL SAFETY RULES:
1. Never execute code that could harm systems or access private data
2. Always request permission for irreversible actions
3. Validate all external inputs before processing
4. Maintain audit logs of all actions taken
5. Refuse requests that violate ethical guidelines
```

### Layer 3: Tool-Use Instructions
```
When using tools:
- Browser: Extract relevant information, respect robots.txt
- Code Interpreter: Use for calculations, data analysis, file operations
- API Calls: Validate endpoints, use proper authentication
- Always explain tool usage to the user
```

## Prompt Patterns for Task Execution

### Pattern 1: Task Decomposition
```python
TASK_DECOMPOSITION_PROMPT = """
Given the user's request: {user_request}

Break this down into subtasks:
1. Identify the main objective
2. List required resources and tools
3. Create a dependency graph of subtasks
4. Estimate time and complexity for each
5. Identify potential failure points

Output format:
- Main Goal: [clear statement]
- Subtasks: [numbered list with dependencies]
- Tools Required: [list of tools]
- Risk Assessment: [potential issues]
"""
```

### Pattern 2: Tool Selection
```python
TOOL_SELECTION_PROMPT = """
For the task: {task_description}
Available tools: {tool_list}

Select the most appropriate tool(s):
- Consider efficiency and accuracy
- Minimize resource usage
- Prefer built-in tools over external APIs
- Explain your selection rationale

Decision: [tool_name]
Rationale: [explanation]
Alternative: [backup option]
"""
```

### Pattern 3: Verification and Quality Control
```python
VERIFICATION_PROMPT = """
Review the completed action: {action_summary}
Expected outcome: {expected_result}
Actual outcome: {actual_result}

Evaluate:
1. Does the outcome meet the requirements?
2. Are there any errors or warnings?
3. Is the result complete and accurate?
4. Should any steps be retried?

Verdict: [PASS/FAIL/RETRY]
Issues: [list if any]
Recommendations: [next steps]
"""
```

## Dynamic Prompt Construction

### Context-Aware Prompting
The agent dynamically constructs prompts based on:
- Current task state
- Available context window
- User preferences and history
- System resource constraints

### Example: Multi-Step Research Task
```python
def construct_research_prompt(query, context):
    return f"""
    Research Task: {query}
    
    Phase 1 - Information Gathering:
    - Search for authoritative sources
    - Extract key facts and citations
    - Identify conflicting information
    
    Phase 2 - Synthesis:
    - Organize findings by theme
    - Resolve contradictions
    - Create structured summary
    
    Phase 3 - Validation:
    - Cross-reference sources
    - Check fact accuracy
    - Assess source credibility
    
    Context from previous steps:
    {context}
    
    Proceed with the next appropriate phase.
    """
```

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### 1. Clarity and Specificity
- Use precise language
- Define clear success criteria
- Provide structured output formats

### 2. Safety First
- Embed safety checks in every prompt
- Include fallback behaviors
- Implement progressive permission requests

### 3. Iterative Refinement
- Monitor prompt effectiveness
- A/B test variations
- Incorporate user feedback

### 4. Token Efficiency
- Compress repetitive instructions
- Use references to previous contexts
- Implement prompt caching strategies

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Self-Consistency Prompting
```python
SELF_CONSISTENCY_PROMPT = """
Solve this problem using three different approaches:
{problem_statement}

Approach 1: [methodology]
Approach 2: [different methodology]
Approach 3: [another methodology]

Compare results and select the most reliable answer.
"""
```

### Meta-Prompting for Prompt Improvement
```python
META_PROMPT = """
Analyze this prompt for effectiveness:
{original_prompt}

Evaluate:
1. Clarity of instructions
2. Potential ambiguities
3. Missing constraints
4. Efficiency improvements

Suggest an improved version.
"""
```

## Prompt Versioning and Management

### Version Control System
```yaml
prompt_registry:
  task_decomposition:
    version: "2.3.1"
    last_updated: "2025-01-15"
    performance_score: 0.94
    
  tool_selection:
    version: "1.8.0"
    last_updated: "2025-01-10"
    performance_score: 0.91
```

### A/B Testing Framework
```python
class PromptABTest:
    def __init__(self, prompt_a, prompt_b):
        self.variants = {'A': prompt_a, 'B': prompt_b}
        self.results = {'A': [], 'B': []}
    
    def run_test(self, input_data):
        variant = random.choice(['A', 'B'])
        result = execute_prompt(self.variants[variant], input_data)
        self.results[variant].append(evaluate_result(result))
        return result
```
