# Hosting Employment Service – Architecture Deep Dive (O3)

> NOTE: This is a structural placeholder. Detailed deep-dive analysis will be generated in a subsequent iteration of the Σ-Builder pipeline.

## Sections to be Expanded

1. Service decomposition (API, async workers, scheduled jobs)
2. Data-layer topology (Postgres primary-read-replicas, ElasticSearch, Redis)
3. Observability stack (OpenTelemetry traces, Prometheus metrics, Loki logs)
4. CI/CD workflow (GitHub Actions → Terraform Cloud → environment promotion)
5. Security hardening (IAM roles, Secrets Manager, mutual-TLS between services)
