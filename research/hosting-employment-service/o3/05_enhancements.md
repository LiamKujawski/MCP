# Enhancements & Future Work – Hosting Employment Service (O3)

> TODO: Explore roadmap items like multi-region active-active Postgres, event-driven architecture with Kafka, and AI-driven autoscaling heuristics.

- **Observability**: Adopt OpenTelemetry collector → OLTP to Honeycomb.
- **Chaos Engineering**: Integrate LitmusChaos experiments for Fargate tasks.
- **Sustainability**: Run carbon-aware scheduler (Cloud Carbon Footprint) for non-critical batch jobs.
- **Compliance**: Automate SOC2 evidence gathering with Prowler + ControlMonkey.
