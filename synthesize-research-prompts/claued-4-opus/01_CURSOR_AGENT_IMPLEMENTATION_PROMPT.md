# Cursor Agent Implementation Prompt: Research Synthesis and Codebase Generation

## Mission Overview

You are tasked with performing a comprehensive synthesis and implementation based on extensive multi-model AI research. Your mission involves three critical phases:

1. **Research Digestion Phase**: Thoroughly read, understand, and synthesize all research from multiple AI models (o3, Claude-4-Opus, Claude-4-Sonnet) across two domains:
   - ChatGPT Agent Architecture and Implementation
   - Codebase Generation Prompt Engineering

2. **Knowledge Integration Phase**: Extract and integrate key insights, patterns, and principles from all perspectives to form a holistic understanding that transcends individual model viewpoints.

3. **Implementation Phase**: Apply the synthesized knowledge to create a production-ready codebase that embodies all learned principles, architectures, and best practices.

## Phase 1: Research Digestion Instructions

### 1.1 Systematic Research Review
You must read and analyze ALL research files in the following directories:
- `chatgpt-agent-research/` (all model subdirectories)
- `codebase-generation-prompt-research/` (all model subdirectories)

For each research document, extract:
- **Core Concepts**: Fundamental principles and architectures proposed
- **Implementation Details**: Specific technical approaches and code patterns
- **Unique Perspectives**: Model-specific insights and innovations
- **Common Patterns**: Recurring themes across multiple models
- **Contradictions**: Areas where models disagree or propose alternatives
- **Enhancement Opportunities**: Future directions and improvements suggested

### 1.2 Cross-Model Synthesis Requirements
When reviewing research from different models:
- **Preserve Diversity**: Value different approaches rather than seeking consensus
- **Identify Synergies**: Find where different model perspectives complement each other
- **Map Relationships**: Understand how concepts from one model relate to another
- **Extract Best Practices**: Identify the strongest elements from each perspective
- **Build Composite Understanding**: Create a mental model that incorporates all viewpoints

### 1.3 Research Processing Order
1. Start with overviews (`01_overview.md`) across all models for both topics
2. Deep dive into architectures (`02_architecture-deep-dive.md`)
3. Study codebase setups (`03_codebase-setup.md`)
4. Analyze prompt structures (`04_prompt-structure.md`)
5. Review enhancements (`05_enhancements.md`)
6. Note any additional files (like `04_agent_platform_reconstruction.md`)
